Hello! My name is Addison Pratt. I'm originally from Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I consider myself a seeker of truth and a lover of learning. I believe Data Science helps me better understand the world around us and the patterns that God has placed in the beautiful world He created.

I enjoy cooking, coding, and learning. This is why I am passionate about the field of Data Science. It is an ever-evolving industry that is both rewarding and insightful for an analytical thinker and ponderer like myself. This blog is intended to share my ideas, thoughts, learning experiences, and applications of data analytics.
